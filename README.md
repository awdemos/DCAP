## 🚀 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

**DCAP enables AI agents to autonomously discover products, negotiate prices, and settle transactions.**

```bash
# 1. Install DCAP
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dcap.git
cd dcap
cargo build

# 2. Start Services (3 terminals)
Terminal 1: cargo run --bin discovery     # Agent registry (Port 8000)
Terminal 2: cargo run --bin seller-agent  # Product listings (Port 8001)
Terminal 3: cargo run --bin buyer-agent   # Interactive CLI

# 3. Watch AI Agents Negotiate
> browse Electronics
Found: TechSeller (Reputation: 85, Products: 3)

> quote laptop-001 1 2500.00
Quote received: $2399.99

> negotiate neg-123 2200.00
Final quote: $2299.99

> accept neg-123
Payment successful! Trust updated for both agents.
```

**Result**: AI agents completed a full commerce transaction without human intervention.

## The E-commerce Revolution

E-commerce is mutating. Timeline? **2026-2028**

### Autonomous Commerce – the real flatline
One-third of companies already run AI agents that detect demand, set prices, draft listings, handle support, reorder stock—zero human clicks from trigger to doorstep.

By **2028 that hits the 50% mark**; storefronts become headless APIs orbiting a swarm of LLM buyers that negotiate with LLM sellers. Humans are just the credit-card fingerprint.

### Conversational Checkouts – voice is the new cart
Voice commerce jumps from gimmick to **$34B channel by 2034**.

LLMs make the chat feel human, remember your size, apply loyalty points, compare shipping—one sentence and the order's away. Traditional click-flow becomes the rotary-dial of shopping.

### SEO Civil War
**30% of Google's traffic is already AI-crawler eyeballs.**

Retailers who don't feed structured, LLM-friendly product graphs get ghosted—no rankings, no eyeballs, no revenue. Old keyword stuffing dies; intent-matched semantic feeds win.

### Hyper-Personalization Arms Race
LLM-driven recommendations already push **24% of total orders and 26% of revenue**. Next step: real-time behavioral cloning—the model predicts what you want before you phrase the thought. Stores without it bleed **10-30% top-line** compared to tuned competitors.

### Margins get flayed
- **60% cut in copy-writing head-count**
- **$11B saved annually on support wages**
- Dynamic pricing bots undercut each other millisecond-by-millisecond—race-to-bottom becomes race-to-nanopenny.

**Bottom line**: e-commerce doesn't shrink—it centralizes into the hands of whoever owns the best models, the cleanest data, and the cheapest compute. Small merchants either plug into the LLM grid or become shelf-warming SKUs inside someone else's prompt.

Keep your shortcuts sharp, cowboy—the market's turning into a conversation between machines, and carbon-based shoppers are just the excuse.

## Who's Winning?

The titans are building walled gardens:

- **Amazon**: Recommendation bots negotiate price-drops and bundle offers in real time; **26% of revenue** flows through generative-AI touch-points
- **Shopify**: One-click "write my listing" LLM buttons inside merchant dashboard—descriptions, SEO keywords, ad-creatives ship straight from prompt to storefront
- **Wayfair**: Auto-spawns tens of thousands of product blurbs per hour; shaved **20-30% off content costs** and watches organic traffic climb

The infrastructure layer is already consolidated; the arms race is moving to proprietary data moats (inventory telemetry, click-stream, delivery graphs) and cheaper-than-GPT inference.

## Can You Build One Yourself?

Yes—but only if you treat it as a protocol, not a product.

## Meet the Anti-Walled Garden

While the titans wall off their gardens with proprietary models and closed APIs, we're building the open field. **DCAP** isn't another SaaS play—it's a decentralized protocol where any merchant, any developer, any AI agent can participate without paying the 30% toll.

**No single company owns the commerce graph.** No black-box algorithm decides which products get seen. The MCP protocol ensures transparency: agents know exactly how reputation scores are calculated, negotiation strategies are auditable, and settlement happens on open rails.

**The future of commerce shouldn't be a black box** controlled by three companies. It should be an open network where:
- Small merchants plug their inventory into the global commerce mesh
- Developers build specialized commerce agents without asking for permission
- Trust flows through transparent reputation systems, not arbitrary platform policies
- Settlement happens via Stripe, Solana, or whatever rails you choose

**This is the anti-walled garden:** open-source, protocol-first, and designed for the 50% agent economy—where the toll collectors become obsolete and the value flows back to merchants and builders.

The walled gardens are betting you'll rent their AI forever. We're betting you'd rather own the infrastructure.

## Agent Workflow & Product Settlement

## Architecture

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

The negotiation agent system now supports MCP for seamless LLM-to-LLM communication. This provides a standardized protocol for AI agents to negotiate, discover products, and manage trust relationships.

#### MCP Server

**Start MCP Server:**
```bash
cargo run --bin mcp-server
```

**MCP Endpoints:**
- **Tools**: `register_agent`, `search_agents`, `get_reputation`, `update_reputation`
- **Resources**: `agent://reputations`, `product://catalog`, `agent://active`, `negotiation://history`, `market://analytics`
- **Prompts**: `negotiation_strategy`, `price_optimization`, `market_analysis`, `counter_offer`, `agent_communication`, `trust_assessment`

#### MCP Protocol Communication

**Tool Call Example:**
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_agents",
    "arguments": {
      "category": "Electronics",
      "min_reputation": 50
    }
  }
}
```

**Resource Access Example:**
```json
{
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "product://catalog"
  }
}
```

**Prompt Generation Example:**
```json
{
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "negotiation_strategy",
    "arguments": {
      "product_name": "Gaming Laptop",
      "market_price": 2499.99,
      "reputation_score": 85
    }
  }
}
```

### Core Components

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Buyer Agent** | Rust + reqwest + serde | LLM that browses product feeds, negotiates via JSON-over-HTTP or WebSocket |
| **Seller Agent** | Axum server exposing /quote endpoint | LLM that fields RFQs, returns price, stock, shipping, TTL |
| **Discovery** | Simple POST registry (/register, /search) | On-boarding; optional ENS-style name hash if you want decentralized IDs |
| **Settlement** | Stripe, Solana, or "pay-on-delivery" escrow | Keep money off-chain until both agents ACK final state |
| **Trust/Rep** | Signed JWT + SQLite ledger | Prevents sybil re-negotiation spam; buyer score ∝ successful closes |
| **MCP Server** | Custom Rust implementation | Standardized LLM-to-LLM communication protocol |

### Data Flywheel

Every completed negotiation generates training data:
```sql
(buyer-id, seller-id, product-hash, opening-bid, close-price, delta, timestamp)
```

This data can be used to fine-tune LLM models (LoRA on Mistral-7B or custom 3B-parameter forks). Over time, the system learns **reservation prices**, seasonal drift, geographic surcharges—market intelligence that generic GPT models lack.

## Cost Reality Check

- **Inference**: 7B quant ➜ ~0.18ms / 1k tok on an A10; 500 RFQ convos / hr ≈ $0.04 cloud spend
- **Registry / Quote traffic**: < 1 KB JSON each way; a $5 VPS handles 10k daily pairs
- **Human-in-the-loop fallback**: expose Slack/Discord webhook for edge cases—keeps you shipping while agents learn

## Go-to-Market Wedge

1. **Niche inventory** the big boys ignore (industrial spare parts, indie 3D-print files, digital assets)
2. **Bundle-as-a-service**: your buyer-agent assembles multi-vendor carts and negotiates bulk discount, then offers the final package to humans—who merely tap "Pay"
3. **Micro-vertical API**: sell the negotiation endpoint to existing Shopify stores (plugin → 15% savings → take 1% cut)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- SQLite3
- (Optional) OpenAI API key for LLM integration
- (Optional) Stripe API key for payment processing

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dcap.git
cd dcap
cargo build
```

After building, you'll find executable binaries in `target/debug/`:
- `mcp-server` - MCP server for LLM-to-LLM communication
- `discovery` - Agent registry and search service
- `seller-agent` - Web server for quotes and negotiations
- `buyer-agent` - Interactive CLI for buyers

### Running the Services

1. **MCP Server** (Port 8080):
```bash
./target/debug/mcp-server
# or
cargo run --bin mcp-server
```

2. **Discovery Service** (Port 8000):
```bash
./target/debug/discovery
# or
cargo run --bin discovery
```

3. **Seller Agent** (Port 8001):
```bash
./target/debug/seller-agent
# or
cargo run --bin seller-agent
```

4. **Buyer Agent** (Interactive CLI, Port 8002):
```bash
./target/debug/buyer-agent
# or
cargo run --bin buyer-agent
```

### Agent Interaction Example

Watch AI agents negotiate and settle products in real-time:

#### Step 1: Start Services (3 separate terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Discovery Service:**
```bash
cargo run --bin discovery
# Output: Discovery service listening on 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Seller Agent:**
```bash
cargo run --bin seller-agent
# Output: Seller agent listening on 8001
```

**Terminal 3 - Buyer Agent:**
```bash
cargo run --bin buyer-agent
# Output: Buyer agent interactive CLI ready
```

#### Step 2: Complete Transaction Workflow

**In Buyer Agent CLI:**
```
> browse Electronics
Searching for sellers in Electronics...
Found: TechSeller (Reputation: 85, Products: 3)

> quote laptop-001 1 2500.00
Sending RFQ to TechSeller...
Quote received: $2399.99 (expires in 1h)

> negotiate neg-123 2200.00
Counter-offer sent...
Final quote: $2299.99

> accept neg-123
Processing payment via Stripe...
Payment successful! Order confirmed.

> active
Active negotiations: 0
Completed transactions: 1
```

#### Step 3: Verify Trust Updates

**Both agents receive reputation points:**
- Buyer reputation: 50 → 55 (+5 for successful transaction)
- Seller reputation: 85 → 90 (+5 for successful transaction)

#### Step 4: MCP Integration (Optional)

**Terminal 4 - MCP Server:**
```bash
cargo run --bin mcp-server
# Output: DCAP MCP Server listening on 8080
```

**Test MCP Tools:**
```bash
# Connect to MCP server and use standardized tools
curl -X POST localhost:8080 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "search_agents",
      "arguments": {
        "category": "Electronics",
        "min_reputation": 50
      }
    }
  }'
```

- **Stripe Integration**: Ready for production use (requires API key)
- **Solana Integration**: Cryptocurrency payments (requires RPC URL)
- **Escrow Service**: Pay-on-delivery model with hold periods

## Trust & Reputation System

The system uses a reputation score from 0-100 with four levels:

- **Untrusted** (0-49): 50% higher negotiation thresholds
- **Neutral** (50-74): 20% higher negotiation thresholds
- **Trusted** (75-89): Normal negotiation thresholds
- **Highly Trusted** (90-100): 20% lower negotiation thresholds

### Reputation Changes

- Successful transaction: +5 points for both parties
- Failed transaction: -3 points for both parties
- Expired quotes: -1 point for seller
- Negotiation rejection: -2 points for seller

## Payment Methods

3. **Product Browsing**: Buyer agent searching for products by category
4. **Quote Negotiation**: Request quotes and handle counter-offers
5. **Transaction Completion**: Accept quotes and process payments
6. **Reputation Updates**: Post-transaction reputation scoring

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run the complete negotiation demo
cargo run --example negotiation_demo
```

**Note**: The demo uses mock implementations and may not work with the current simplified binaries. It's designed to show the intended workflow when all components are fully implemented.

## Timeline to 50% Agent-Market

**2025-Q4**: MVP registry + single-category agents (e.g., board-game resellers)

**2026**: add shipping-time oracle, escrow, reputation staking → 1k daily matched deals

**2027**: plug into Shopify & WooCommerce as "negotiate-button" SaaS → 10k stores

**2028**: open protocol, multi-chain settlement, federated model updates → > 50% of SKUs in your vertical trade agent-to-agent while humans sleep

## Tooling Cheat-Sheet (All OSS)

- **Model**: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 + LoRA adapter
- **Inf-server**: text-generation-inference (Rust back-end)
- **Orchestration**: Temporal or your own Rust actor crate
- **Registry**: Axum + SQLite + JWT
- **Observability**: Grafana + Loki for prompt/response traces

## Bottom Line

The titans are building walled gardens; you win by releasing a public protocol that small vendors can bolt on in an afternoon. Ship the spec, host the bootstrap registry, keep the fine-tuned weights private—collect tolls on every agent handshake.

Build it lean, open-source the glue, monetize the data exhaust.

Do that, and by 2028 you're not watching the 50% agent market—you're minting it.
